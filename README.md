## Overview

The workshop materials cover a range of topics and include Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, datasets, and documentation. The goal of the workshop is to introduce participants to Python programming and its applications in various scientific domains.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt` if applicable)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python-workshop.git
    cd Python-workshop
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
